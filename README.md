# 🛒 GrocerAI

The Intelligent Grocery Companion

GrocerAI is a high-performance Flutter application that leverages Artificial Intelligence to transform how you plan, shop, and manage your kitchen. No more manual typing or forgotten ingredients; let AI handle the logistics.

✨ Key Features

🥗 AI Recipe-to-List Engine
Paste a recipe name or a URL, and GrocerAI's NLP engine extracts the necessary ingredients, automatically adjusting quantities and categories for your shopping trip.

🧠 Predictive Smart Suggestions
Our "Historical Insight" algorithm analyzes your shopping patterns:
Frequency Tracking: Identifies your "Must-Haves."
Time-Since-Purchase: Predicts when you're running low (e.g., "You bought milk 3 days ago; you're likely out!").

📸 Instant Price Scanner
Use your camera to scan items in-store. GrocerAI instantly pulls pricing data and fills your list details, helping you track your budget in real-time.

♻️ Persistent Lists & Templates
Save your "Weekly Essentials" or "Holiday Feast" lists. Reuse, edit, and sync them across devices so you never have to start from scratch.

🚀 Technical Architecture
GrocerAI is built with a focus on speed and offline-first reliability.
